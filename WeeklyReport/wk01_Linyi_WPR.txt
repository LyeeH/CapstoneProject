Summary:
This week I have worked on using Python and tkinter, and worked out a simple example, which can be view in 'Code folder/wk01_example.py'
Here are some information that may helps you:
Locate a file and get the path		use	tkinter.filedialog
Draw a Table 				use	tkinter.ttk.Treeview
(ttk is in tkinter and there are more cool things we can use in ttk)

Issue:
1. For me, tkinter is not friendly enough to build a table. If anyone got how to highlight or change the background for specific section under inputing some filtering information, please teach me how to do that.
2. Still need to study how to build a readable and re-used code.
3. We need to build a effective filter to search all kinds of data that may input.

Data:
Check under 'Code/wk01_example.py'

Next Week:
1. Try to build a table that can highlight under specific situation
2. Find another way for the filter.
