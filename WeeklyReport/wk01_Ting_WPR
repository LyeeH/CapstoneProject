WeeklyReport
Jan 14, 2018	Week1	Ting Wang

Summary:
This week I focused on creating a GUI Window to input a destination file and changing the input data to xls file. I tried some small
example to understand the function of relative command. During the process, I get in the trouble due to some trivial problem. It wasted 
some time. I searched some hlepful example in the web, which follows the version of Python2, but not suit for Python3.
For example, the individual module tkFileDialog for Python2 had changed to tkinter.filedialog. When you want to use the command, you must 
write in the front of code like 'from tkinter import filedialog'.

Issue:
1. The speed of learning is too slow. Thanks to Linyi's code, it helps me focus on some special command.
2. The helpful material I search is often not suit the version of Python I am using.
3. How to read data from a xls file and create a table in the Gui window. It is the problem I will focus on next week.  

Data:
I just tried some example to be familar with command. There is not a complete working code.

Next Week:
Try to read data from a xls file and create a table in the Gui window and find the methon to hightlight the elements of table.
