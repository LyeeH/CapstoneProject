Summary:
This week, I worked on being familiar with wxpython. I wasted some time 
to solve the problem of importing wx.grid, which is used to build GUI table, under Linux system. After getting the help of Linyi,
I solved the problem by install the prerequisites packages. Because I read and understand the documentation, the process is going forward slowly.
I didn't finish converting my code to wxpyhton version.

Next week:
Finish converting all my code to wxpython version.
