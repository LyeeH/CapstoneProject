Summary:
This week was mainly a continuation of the first week in regards to familiarizing myself with python’s tkinter package. I experimented with manipulating tables using a resource Linyi was able to find: http://tktable.sourceforge.net/ Two resources I also was able to find that I found provided excellent general information on tkinter are: http://www.tkdocs.com/tutorial/ and https://docs.python.org/2/library/tkinter.html

Next Week:
Incorporate ideas/things learned from tkinter examples to the data provided by Ataur.
