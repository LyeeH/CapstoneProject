Weekly Report
Linyi Hong        Feb 25, 2018    Week 7

Summary:
This week I searched something about JavaScript and also focused on fixing code bug and make it more clear.
I also use pandas to do the sort function, and it seems cool.

About JS:
I google JS and ask other people about using JS as GUI and python as data analysis. It seems we need to learn a lot
if we transfer our GUI to JS. In order to use JS, we also need to learn HTML and CSS. And JS is based on browser, so
we need to struggle with browser and localhost stuff too since we use python in the back-end.

About Other Python GUI library:
There are several good GUI library that python offer. However, the one I am looking for only opensource for indiviual usage,
called PyQt. Other GUI offer pretty much the same function as Tkinter and I did not focus on that too much.

For Tkinter, Tktable, and pandas:
1. Fixed the red background problem, so it will not turn red anymore!
2. pandas is a opensource data analysis library that Python offer, which is very powerful. My code use pandas now, but still not done.
     i) Basically pandas offer a back-end table, and I do sort or analyze on that table.
     ii) The show-up table based on the back-end table, so if double click the title, the back-end table will be sorted, and 
        send the data to update the front-end table (the show-up table).
     iii) pandas can do more powerful things, like calculated sum, std, ave, min, max and soon, and it also easy to use with 
          matplotlib.
          
Next week:
I will still focus on pandas and combine all the function into one interface. Of course, it based on we still using Tk not JS.
