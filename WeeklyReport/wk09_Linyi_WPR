Linyi Hong     Mar 12, 2018    Week 9

Summary:
For week 9 and week 10, I am more focus on the final exam.
I spent some time on exploring regular experssion this week, and come out with an idea about how to finish 
the task with Xiaoqiao. We probabily will finish the test in several day after the finial exam.

Issue:
I have noticed that some of the startpoint and endpoint have some addition information, for example,
  Startpoint: wdata[0] (... from rclk)
  Endpoirnt: rempty[0][0] (... from wclk)
Does the table need to show the content in '()'?
